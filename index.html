         <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The head element contains information that is not visible to the user</li>
          <li>The body element is known as the parent element</li>
          <li>The nested elements within a body element are known as child elements</li>
          <li>It is important to use semantic html elements, such as body, when possible as it makes your html easier to read by other developers and the browser</li>
          <li>Visible content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
          <li>The CSS rule is made up of a selector (which defines the element or attributes to which the rules will apply) and declations (which contain two important components - the CSS property and value)</li>
          <li>CSS determines the styles of a webpage in order to make a website visually appealing</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout main: takes you back to the main branch</li>
          <li>git revert: command to revert to the previous version of code</li>
          <li>It's important to work on tasks on feature branches first and then merge into the main branch</li>
          <li>The main branch should be the final most updated version of your application</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>You can create conditional statements giving one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy the computer will execute the code provided between (), otherwise if it's false, the code won't execute, interrupting the control flow</li>
          <li>for loops are often used to repeat a task and iterate over an array with only a few lines of code</li>
          <li>Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task</li>
          <li>You can comment out parts of code instead of deleting so you can come back to it later by using /* and */ at the beginning and end of the code</li>
        <li>You can randomise a selection using the Math function</li>
        <li>In order to execute a function, you must call it in your code</li>
